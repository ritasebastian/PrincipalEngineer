## üß† Why Connect VPCs?

When you have:
- Multiple **AWS accounts**
- Multiple **regions**
- Different **teams or microservices**

You often want them to **talk to each other securely** without going through the internet.

## üîó Common Ways to Connect VPCs

| Method | Best For | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **VPC Peering** | Simple 1-to-1 VPC connection | Low cost, no transit |
| **Transit Gateway** | Many VPCs or multi-account setups | Scalable, hub-and-spoke model |
| **PrivateLink** | Secure access to services across VPCs | Great for exposing services without full VPC access |
| **VPN or Direct Connect** | On-prem to AWS VPC | Used in hybrid cloud setups |

---

## üîÑ Method 1: **VPC Peering**

### üîß Steps:
1. VPC A sends a **peering request** to VPC B
2. VPC B **accepts the request**
3. Both sides update **route tables** to point to the peer connection
4. (Optional) Update **security groups** to allow traffic

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:
- No **transitive routing** (A ‚Üî B, B ‚Üî C doesn‚Äôt mean A ‚Üî C)
- Max ~125 connections per region per VPC

‚úÖ Great for: Connecting 2‚Äì3 simple VPCs in the same or different AWS accounts

---

## üåê Method 2: **Transit Gateway (TGW)**

> üß† Think of TGW as a **central router** for all your VPCs and VPNs.

### üîß Steps:
1. Create a **Transit Gateway**
2. Attach your VPCs to the TGW
3. Update **route tables** in each VPC to route traffic via TGW
4. Optionally attach **VPNs or Direct Connect**

### ‚úÖ Benefits:
- **Scales to 1000s of VPCs**
- Supports **inter-region VPC connectivity**
- Enables **transitive routing**

‚úÖ Great for: Multi-account, multi-VPC enterprise setups

---

## üîå Method 3: **AWS PrivateLink**

> Expose services across VPCs **without VPC peering** or **full network access**.

### Example:
- VPC A runs a service (API, DB)
- VPC B wants to access it
- You create an **Endpoint Service** in VPC A
- VPC B creates a **VPC Endpoint** to consume it

‚úÖ Great for: **B2B services**, **service mesh**, **multi-tenant platforms**

## üß≠ Quick Decision Guide

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Connect 2 VPCs | ‚úÖ VPC Peering |
| Connect 10+ VPCs or accounts | ‚úÖ Transit Gateway |
| Expose service across VPCs securely | ‚úÖ PrivateLink |
| Connect to on-prem | ‚úÖ VPN or Direct Connect |
