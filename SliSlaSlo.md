### 🔹 **SLI – Service Level Indicator**

**What it is**:  
A **metric** that tells you how well your service is performing from the user's point of view.

**Think of it as**:  
📏 "What do we measure?"

**Examples**:
- **Availability**: % of successful requests (e.g., 99.95%)
- **Latency**: % of requests served under 300ms
- **Error Rate**: % of failed API responses

---

### 🔹 **SLO – Service Level Objective**

**What it is**:  
A **goal or target** you set for your SLIs over a specific period of time.

**Think of it as**:  
🎯 "What do we aim for?"

**Examples**:
- "99.9% of requests must succeed over a rolling 30-day period."
- "95% of login requests should complete in under 200ms."

> SLOs help **internal teams** set reliability goals and manage error budgets.

---

### 🔹 **SLA – Service Level Agreement**

**What it is**:  
A **formal agreement** (usually with customers or external users) defining what level of service they can expect — and **penalties** if you don’t meet it.

**Think of it as**:  
📜 "What did we promise to the user?"

**Examples**:
- "99.95% uptime guaranteed per month. If not met, 10% service credit will be provided."

### 🔁 How They Relate:

| Term | Meaning | Who It's For | Binding? |
|------|--------|--------------|----------|
| **SLI** | Actual performance metric | Engineers | No |
| **SLO** | Internal reliability target | Engineers/Managers | No |
| **SLA** | External commitment | Customers | Yes ✅ |

---

### 💡 In Platform Engineering:

When you build internal platforms (developer portals, CI/CD systems, Kubernetes platforms, etc.):

- **SLIs** measure how reliable or fast the platform is.
- **SLOs** are goals you set so teams know what "good" looks like.
- **SLAs** are commitments you might make to other internal teams or business units.

## 🎯 Platform Engineering Example: Kubernetes Platform

Let’s say you want to define SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs for **pod scheduling reliability** and **deployment speed** on your platform.

---

### ✅ **1. SLI – Service Level Indicator**

These are the **actual measurements** from your system:

| SLI Name | What It Measures | Example Metric |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Pod Scheduling Success Rate** | % of pods successfully scheduled within X seconds | `kube_scheduler_scheduling_duration_seconds_bucket` |
| **Deployment Latency** | Time taken for a deployment to be available | Measure time from `kubectl apply` to all pods ready |
| **Control Plane Uptime** | API server availability | Uptime of `kube-apiserver` |
| **API Server Error Rate** | % of 5xx errors from API server | `/apiserver_request_total` with `code=5xx` |

---

### 🎯 **2. SLO – Service Level Objective**

These are the **goals** you set for those SLIs. For example:

| SLO | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| 99.95% of pods should be scheduled within 5 seconds | Ensures fast scaling/deployments |
| 99.9% control plane uptime over 30 days | Ensures API server is always available |
| 95% of deployments should complete in under 2 minutes | Helps developers get fast feedback |
| <0.1% API server 5xx errors over 30 days | API server must be reliable |

These are **internal goals** — used to maintain **error budgets** and reliability targets.

---

### 📜 **3. SLA – Service Level Agreement**

These are formal guarantees you might offer **internal teams or business units**.

| SLA | Penalty/Remedy |
|-----|----------------|
| Kubernetes API will be available 99.9% monthly | If breached, dedicated support investigation |
| Scheduled jobs will be executed with <1 min delay 99.5% of the time | Escalation within 2 hours if missed |
| Deployment pipeline will deploy within 5 mins 98% of the time | Manual override provided if SLO missed |

> SLAs are usually agreed upon between Platform Team and internal stakeholders or customers.

### 💡 Bonus: **Why It Matters**

- **SLIs** give visibility 📊
- **SLOs** set the bar 📈
- **SLAs** hold you accountable 📜
