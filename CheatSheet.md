## 🧱 1. **Kubernetes & Cloud-Native Cheat Sheet**

| Topic | Key Points |
|-------|------------|
| **K8s Internals** | API Server → etcd → Scheduler → Controller Manager. Know Pod lifecycle, Node status, Events. |
| **Networking** | ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, Ingress. Understand DNS, kube-proxy, CNI plugins. |
| **Scaling** | HPA (CPU/mem), VPA, Cluster Autoscaler. Watch out for resource limits & OOMKills. |
| **Security** | RBAC, ServiceAccounts, PodSecurityPolicies (PSPs → Pod Security Admission), Secrets & ConfigMaps. |
| **Helm** | Charts, values.yaml, templating, chart dependencies. |
| **Operators** | CRDs + Controllers, Operator SDK. |
| **Monitoring** | Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana dashboards (CPU, memory, latency). |
| **Logging** | EFK stack or Loki with Promtail. Query logs for debugging app issues. |
| **CI/CD** | ArgoCD for GitOps, Canary/Rolling/Blue-Green deployments. |

## 🧠 2. **System Design Cheat Sheet**

| Area | Must Know |
|------|-----------|
| **Scalability** | Stateless services behind LB, use caching (Redis), database sharding. |
| **Availability** | Multi-AZ/multi-region setup, readiness/liveness probes, retries & backoff. |
| **Observability** | Logs, metrics (SLIs), traces. Integrate with Prometheus, OpenTelemetry. |
| **Data Flow** | API → Queue → Workers → DB. Real-time: Kafka + Stream Processor. |
| **DB Layer** | Read replicas, failover, connection pooling. CAP theorem trade-offs. |
| **Design Patterns** | Circuit Breaker, Retry, Bulkhead, Saga, Sidecar. |
| **Rate Limiting** | Token bucket / leaky bucket, per-user/IP throttling. |
| **Caching** | Cache aside (read-through), invalidation, TTLs. |

🧪 *Practice with: Design a Monitoring Platform like ZDX, or Logging System like ELK Stack.*

## 📊 3. **Data & AI (ZDX Context) Cheat Sheet**

| Topic | Essentials |
|-------|------------|
| **Data Pipeline** | Kafka → Flink/Spark → DB/Data Lake. Real-time vs Batch. |
| **ML Infra Awareness** | Deploying models with Kubeflow, model versioning (MLflow), GPU scheduling. |
| **Vector DBs** | FAISS, pgvector, Redis-Search – use for semantic search. |
| **RAG** | Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Store doc chunks → embed → retrieve on query. |
| **ZDX Domain** | Internet health monitoring → Collect client telemetry → Correlate with network/SaaS issues. |
| **Telemetry** | Latency, packet loss, app error rates → Real-time stream analysis. |
| **Time Series DB** | InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, Prometheus TSDB. |

## 👨‍💼 4. **Leadership & Strategy Cheat Sheet**

| Trait | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| **Mentorship** | Onboarding docs, pair programming, regular design reviews. |
| **Vision** | “Build once, scale many” → reusable platforms, internal tooling. |
| **Cross-team Collab** | Aligning with security, compliance, dev teams. |
| **Project Execution** | Breaking epics, tracking delivery, risk mitigation. |
| **Innovation** | Suggesting new tools (e.g., moving to GitOps), automating toil. |
| **Prioritization** | Balance between reliability, speed, and cost (error budget strategy). |

📌 Be ready to talk about:  
- A time you saved money at scale  
- Led an incident and made postmortem improvements  
- Moved teams from legacy to platform thinking

## 💬 5. **Behavioral & Fit (STAR) Cheat Sheet**

| Scenario | Response Tips |
|----------|---------------|
| **Failure** | Admit mistake, lessons learned, preventive steps taken. |
| **Conflict** | Show empathy, align with goals, data-driven resolution. |
| **Leadership** | Focus on team wins, mentorship, long-term impact. |
| **Innovation** | Talk about PoCs turned into tools, or process automation. |
| **Resilience** | Handling pressure, learning from outages, bouncing back stronger. |
