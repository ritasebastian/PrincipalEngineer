## üîê What is SSL/TLS?

- **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** and **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** are protocols that **encrypt data** as it travels over the network.
- This protects **sensitive information** (like usernames, passwords, queries) from being read or modified by hackers.

> ‚úÖ TLS is the modern version of SSL. (TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are used today)

## üìö Real-World Example: **MySQL + SSL/TLS**

Let‚Äôs say you have:
- A **MySQL server** running on a remote Linux machine.
- A **MySQL client** (like DBeaver or command-line) on your laptop.

Without SSL:
- You connect ‚Üí send your **username, password, and queries in plain text**.
- A hacker sniffing the network could see your login info.

With SSL:
- The connection is **encrypted**, so even if someone intercepts it, they see only garbage (not readable text).

## üîÑ How SSL/TLS Works in MySQL (Step-by-Step)

### üü© 1. **MySQL Server has Certificates**
Think of a **certificate** like a digital ID.

MySQL server must have:
- `ca.pem` ‚Äì Certificate Authority (CA) file
- `server-cert.pem` ‚Äì Server's public certificate
- `server-key.pem` ‚Äì Server's private key

These are usually stored in `/etc/mysql/ssl/` or a custom path.

---

### üü© 2. **Client Uses Certificates to Verify Server**

Client can have:
- `ca.pem` ‚Äì to verify server identity
- `client-cert.pem` ‚Äì client public cert (optional)
- `client-key.pem` ‚Äì client private key (optional)

This lets **mutual authentication** happen (if both sides check each other).

---

### üü® 3. **SSL Handshake Process (Simplified)**

1. ‚úÖ Client says: "Hi, I want to talk securely."
2. üîë Server says: "Here‚Äôs my certificate."
3. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Client verifies it using the CA (`ca.pem`).
4. üîê They agree on an encryption method (TLS 1.2 etc.)
5. üì¶ All communication is now encrypted!

---

## üß™ Example: Connecting to MySQL over SSL (from client)

```bash
mysql -u username -p \
  --ssl-ca=ca.pem \
  --ssl-cert=client-cert.pem \
  --ssl-key=client-key.pem \
  -h your-mysql-server.com
```

> If the server is configured to **require SSL**, it will **reject** non-encrypted connections.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è MySQL Server Config (usually in `my.cnf`):

```ini
[mysqld]
ssl-ca=/etc/mysql/ssl/ca.pem
ssl-cert=/etc/mysql/ssl/server-cert.pem
ssl-key=/etc/mysql/ssl/server-key.pem
require_secure_transport = ON
```

---

## üîç How to Check if MySQL Connection is Encrypted?

After connecting:

```sql
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Ssl_cipher';
```

If SSL is working, it will show something like:
```
+---------------+---------------------+
| Variable_name | Value               |
+---------------+---------------------+
| Ssl_cipher    | TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 |
+---------------+---------------------+
```

If it says `''` (empty), then SSL is **not** being used.
